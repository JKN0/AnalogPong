#Analog Pong

Analog Pong is a traditional pong-style game implemented mostly with analog circuits. All video generation is analog and so is most of the game logic. There are some basic gate and flip-flop level digital circuits used.

Device plays three switch-selectable games: 
* normal two-player tennis
* one-player tennis with automatic opponent
* simple solo-squash

It generates PAL-compatible black&white video signal. Sounds are fed directly to a speaker.
